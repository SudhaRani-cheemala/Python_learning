MAVEN:
  all files together in every repository have may me milloins of files
  build file will be created together of all files collection
  we call it as artifacts
 How to create the build file:
     can we structure our project and support files??
       manual process is not possible to import or download library
       now we can manage our project we need a tool called build software/build tool
  along with build it has to download and identify the dependencies so we can call it as project management tool/or build software
  Ant support only java application(old one)
  for the extension of this one java application which supports python,.net, java which is open source(MAVEN)
  it will geerate .jar file(for pure java file)
  for web application .war file(based on java)
  .jsp also(for web pages)
  for enterprise application .ear files will be created
  What is build in MAVEN?????
    build = compile + test + package(jar/war/ear depending on project)
    exaample:
      xyz.java---------compile------->xyz.class------->xyz.jar------->version1.0
       Maven is java based tool
       Maven is open source
       maven is free
       maven is java based web application
       maven is developed by Apache(Parent)
Prerequisites:
    1).Check if java is installed or not(need to install): yum install java(java version required for maven)
    2). Check for java compiler : yum install javac*
    3).download Maven from official maven page -->tar.gz file come-->wget <url of application>
    4).need to extract the file and copy to /opt folder

  yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y
    2  yum install javac
    3  clear
    4  wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.3/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.3-bin.tar.gz
    5  ls
    6  tar xzvf apache-maven-3.9.3-bin.tar.gz
    7  ls
    8  tar xzvf apache-maven-3.9.3-bin.tar.gz -C /opt
    9  ls
   10  ls -l /opt/
   11  mvn --versio
   12  en
   13  env
   14  ls -l /opt/
   18  env
   19  clear
   20  ls -l /opt/
   21  export M2_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-3.9.3
   22  export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin
   23  env
   24  history

    How to structure our project:
    How to use maven:
        basically project structure is decided by the developing team.
        mvn archetype:generate
        we can generate project structure number by using maven:
           project management activity: mvn archetype:generate(now it will go to central repository)
           3307: remote -> za.co.absa.hyperdrive:component-archetype_2.12 (-)
           3307 is a project structure number 
           1: 1.0-alpha-4
2: 1.0
3: 1.0.1
4: 1.3
5: 1.4
 tota 5 versions 
 ->dowloading all files
 ->including POM
 ->asking for groupid(groupid is nothing but reverse naming conversion (com.cloudbot.www))
 ->asking for artifact id(combination of all supporting and all programming files)
 ->asking for sanpshot(the version is not finalised untill you give sanpshot id)
 Finally project structure is ready.


 .POM file (project object model):this file decides what libraries and supporting files required 
     .

commnads:
  mvn validate
  mvn compile
    Target folder will be craeted after successful compilation
  mvn test(in local repository .m2 the libraries will be downloaded)
  class file will be craeted and (that is in binary language)    
  mvn package(package related plugins will be dowloaded from central repository into local .m2)
 How to check the list of files in .jar file-------> jar -tvf target/cloudbot_jarproj-1.0-SNPSHOT.jar
   by using commnad java -cp target/cloudbot_jarproj-1.0-SNPSHOT.jar com.cloudbot.www.App
 mvn clean--->want to clean  (now the target folder will be vaished)
