MAVEN:
  all files together in every repository have may me milloins of files
  build file will be created together of all files collection
  we call it as artifacts

     can we structure our project and support files??
       manual process is not possible to import or download library
       now we can manage our project we need a tool called build software/build tool
  along with build it has to download and identify the dependencies so we can call it as project management tool/or build software
