Purpose of SCM/VCS
SCM(Source code management)
VCS(Version control System)
Keep tracking the code.
How to know which developer worked on which source code
How to know which developer has modified source code
Need keep track of all the changes.
Central version control system: mo local copy,no limitations,diskful erros,lazy transfer,if it is down no developer can use this one
Disributed version control systems:
  mostly these are cloud based technologies
  ex:github,bit bucket,gitlab
  once you create your github account all developers will get the access by giving permission to the repo or anything
  Advantages:every developer can have a local copy 
            if github is down the developers will have local copy
            smart transfer mechanism which means it compress the file
 ------------------what are the file types can be used---------in Disributed version control system----------
 it is meant for programming files
 some supporting text files(READ ME files,pdf files)
 ---------------what files are not suitable----------------------------
 lot of images (jpeg,png,jpg)
 mp3 files (s3 bucket)
 video files
 --------------who is actually use git or github---------------------
 how a days who ever is involved in the project all are using git
 --------------------Hoe to install git----------------------------
 we can install git on all platforms
 official download pages
  yum install git -y
  206  git --version
  207  mkdir cloudbot
  208  cd cloudbot/
  209  cd ..
  210  realpath cloudbot/
  211  cd cloudbot/
  212  git init
  213  clear
  214  ls -la
  215  history

  After installation the configuration will be done:
    git config --global user.name "Sudha"
    git config --global user.email "csudharani37@gmail.com"
  how to list the global parameters in git
  git config --list
  NOTE: After git init command the respective folder will become reppository .git
  ---------------------Created a file with some logic-----------------
  git will track this particular file
git commands
  git status--->identifies new files 
  to track it add git add . or git add <file name>
  after git add command the all tracked files are available in 2nd stage this we can call cashe area or temporary area file will be added to this area
  working area to staging area
  git status(bcz file is in staging area the file will be in green in colour it is yet to be commited)
  git commit -m "my first program"-->m for message(ready to be push into remote repository)
  git status(exp o/p:working tree is clean)
  git rm --cached first.sh (You can untrack a file which is tracked )
  git restore <filename>-->can restore the modified file from staging area to working area
   git commit -am "added line of code"--->you can add and commit both at a same time
   if you use rm for delete a file it can be restorte form git only
   ------------how to check what changes happed in your local repository------------
   git log---> will give all the changes or commits history
   git show   ----> will give the content in this particular version
   git diff --->is for difference between latest and previous commits

  git push()
