linux is an operating system
operating system which will convert user instruction into machine understandable language or binary language
linux is a opensource(original source code of the application)
linux is secured operating system(security in linux is layer base it is in built in o/s)
firewall similar o security groups in aws
it has advanced file security
for windows we call it as 
regular uesrs are normal users
user-->entity which consumes system resources(resources can be cpu,hdd,ram,network)
system resources means components of server or machine
types of users in linux:
  root/admin user/system users(in windows we can call it as admin user and for linux we call it as root user)
  Regular uesrs
  Application users
System users: system users will created alomg with o/s installation
   example: root/admin user(default while installing o/s)  
Application user: After installation of o/s we can install additiona softwares or applications(Application level usage users)
   example: if you install httpd internally apache user will be installed
Normal uesrs: Normal users are created by O/S admins(System users)
How to identify users:
  we can create almost 65k uesrs
  every usesr has a unique id
  linux is a command line operating system
  command:id uers name
  linux has given range of Uid'S
  uid=0-99-->system user/admin/root user
  uid=100-999-->application user
  uid=1000-65k-->normal users
  root user id always haviung a id as 0     
    [root@ip-172-31-28-243 ~]# id root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
 Groups:
  Collection/Set of users with common goal
Important files for user management:
  -->user information file
  -->all main configuration files are stored in /etc(forwad slash is root user)  /etc/passwd  (here user information will be there) 
  --->group info-->/etc/group
  -->Password information of the user--->/etc/shadow
every users has there own home folder
   root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash(with the help of root user only the O/S will bootup)
if iam creating a user this user info will be seen in passwd file
if you create a user with same name one group will be created
commands:
  add user-->adduser username
  add group-->groupadd groupname  
/home/user/bin/bash----->/bin/bash means by shell(acts as an program/software which will helps user to interact with underlying operating system)
  
Note:if you create a user automatically it creates group
srujan:!!:19535:0:99999:7:::
      19535-->uid
      0-->group id
      99999-expiration date of the acoount
      "7": This number represents the number of days before the password can be changed
      "::": These empty colons (::) represent the fields for the account's minimum password age, maximum password age, and password warning period. Since these fields are empty, it suggests that there are no specific values set for these parameters.
      Overall, the given string indicates that the "srujan" user account has a locked or disabled password, a UID of 19535, belongs to the "root" group, does not have an expiration date, requires password changes every 7 days, and has no specific values set for the minimum and maximum password ages or password warning period.

  here !! means we can set the password for the user
  here * means we can't create password means system users
How to set the password for the user:
    command-->passwd username  
    srujan:$6$hwtvW.zQs0PQsMwP$5qndn/1KqtnuQb1EMsB.H9dzMiJL3UXk8RSoeM8EIzgajyYB.0QGRCBvH14PbGZSEkZ/UZ4NG8rPQf3uyoIJ01:19535:0:99999:7:::
    here $ means 
    For example, in the given string, the section starting with "$6$" suggests that the password is encrypted using the SHA-512 algorithm. The subsequent section after the second dollar sign ($) contains the salt value, which is used to add complexity to the password encryption process.
How to create a group:
  add user to newly created group
  ** while creating the user add to group command--->useradd -G groupname username
  ** After creating the user(modifying the user) for existing user--> usermod -a -G groupname username   
     -a is append
     -G is group
  modify group name-->groupmod -n newgroupname old group name  
  change group id--> groupmod -g <gid> <group name>  
  Single user to multiple groups--->usermod -aG grp1,grp2,grp3
  delete user-->userdel srujan
how to handle user while deleting:
-->lock the user
-->All the user work will be stored in /home folder of the user(/home/srujan)  
-->Take the backup of the user home folder
-->After remove or delete the user

How to lock user-->usermod -L username
   sriram:!$6$Oj5Pi7YmLwxTdn48$oMdser7CGMGs3LKO2Nm8UQX6USBm02K/Murv/b5D4SpLbs8.c.9wxR2kBCeSo4iSBQpM0R/aIl7f5QECk62jm.:19535:0:99999:7:::
  !$ means user account got locked
userdel usrername  it will remove information from the configuration files only they tring to maintain the home directory
remove user completely--->userdel -r username--> -r means recursively removes directories
How to copy or take backup cp /home/sriram/* /tmp
delete-->userdel sriram
delete withdata->userdel -r sriram
How to unlock the user-->usermod -U username
users file means :. It defines the privileges and permissions granted to users and user groups when using the "sudo" command, which allows users to run commands with administrative (root) privileges.
The "sudoers" file is located at "/etc/sudoers" and can only be edited by the root user or users with administrative privileges
how to add users to sudoers file:
    -->add user to special group called "wheel"
       so the user will become root user and from there any user can be logged in but eventhouh if you add user to wheel group while logging into the user use sudo before this
