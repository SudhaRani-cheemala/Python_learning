version control system:
how to work with multiple files in git:
nothing to commit, working tree clean--->which means the files are commited the local repository.
how to filter git log information: git log --oneline(entire  information will bw given)
bafcac5 (HEAD -> master) craeted empty file
e9a3fe0 created
e9fbc79 added line of code
d3e510a added extra code
0e85cb2 first program

it is displaying 7 character commit id
head always poits to the latest commit
how to find the code changes based on commit of code timely bases: git log --oneline --since yyyy-mm-dd
 git log --oneline --since 2023-07-14
how to find the code commits before the date until
git log --oneline --until 2023-07-05

which menas until 10th we have commits.

Note:want to know the commits after the particlular date use since
:want to know the commits before the particlular date use until

want to know who wrote or modified code:  git log --author "sudha" --oneline
want to combine :git log --author "sudha" --oneline --since yyyy-mm-dd--->this can give since sudha how many commits she done
To search huge files by author:git log --author "sudha" --oneline --grep "first.java"(usimg grep command for search)
to understand the last 10 commit id's:git log -5(here you will get last 5 commits)
how to differentiate between 2 days of commit:
   between 2 range of dates:git log --since 2023-07-05 --until 2023-07-08 --oneline --author "sudha" -1(we can combine every command -1 means last change done by the author)
   single - for integers double - for strings
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Want to track .txt or.py or .java files
if you want to ignore some files:
ignoring the file types: .gitignore--->this is a hidden file as developer or devops engineer can craete
 *.py
 *.txt
 *.docker  like this we can give syntax in gitignore file
 here every file which is .py or.txt or.docker files can be ignored but you want to exclude some particular file
 just give !filename with extension 
 -------------------------how to ignore file starting with particluar letter----------
in gitignore file add letter which you want to ignore like (aeiou)*.net
---------------------how to  rename  a file in GIT--------------------------
after commit only we can rename a file
linux command to rename a file :mv old_filename new_filename
in GIT --->git mv <old_filename> <new_filename>--->it will change the name and commit to the staging area only.-->if you do git status
it will be as green colour only.
after commit only the rename will be done.
------------how to remove git file-------------
git rm <filename> --->it is going to staging area untill you are commiting it the activity will not be completed.
(shift+delete) enter--->permenantly deleted
delete+enter--->recycle bin
remove file using linux normal delete
git remove means you cannot get it back
git restore is for staging area to working area: git restore --staged .\.gitignore

rm file.txt
git status
git checkout -- file.txt ---->checkout the file from local directory to project directory(the file is back to project directory)
but git rm will delete the file after you commit it.
------------------GIT RESET COMMAND----------
if you are doing changes in working area or staging or local repository area i wanted to undo the changes
soft
hard
mixed
if your file is in working area git --soft
if your file is in staging area git --mixed -->for both working and staging area(this is the default method a git will use)
if your file is in repository arae git --hard---> but this will work in working/staging/repository area 
dont use rm -rf command to delete file
--------------------------
in git copy is called as create a branch
git branch-->which branch
create a copy of a branch---->git branch <new-branch_name>

----------------------------17/07/23-------------------------------------------------
How to resolve the merge conflicts:
  git merge --abort --->to abort the merge but this is not always
  whatever merge we done want to abort with the help of abort command the will be used
2).fix the conflicts:
     dev1,dev2--->who is correct?
     evalute to manager
     open the coflict file
     the file will be implemeted 
     upfarte the file
     git status
     git add .
     git commit
     conflict resolved
How to rename a branch:
  git branch --move or -m oldbranch_name new_branchname
  can we reanme master branch??---->yes but it is not recommanded.
How to delete a branch
   git branch -d branchname (here d for delete)
Can we delete master branch------> Yes we can but not recommanded.
   git branch -D branchname (here D means forcefully it will delete the branch)          
----------------CREATING THE REMOTE REPOSITORY-----------------------------
   git remote
   git remote -v
   login into git hub accout and right side corner plus symbol is there click on it and sleect new repository
   allow everyone give public
   if it is a free account only one private repository will be created
   READ ME file is av=bout a written file about project.
   after that copy the command:
      remote repository name is origin
      git remote add origin https://github.com
      in your project directory local remote area will be created.
      working area--->staging arae-->local repository area--->local remote repository area
      from local repository area the file will go to remote repository(git push) for uploading 
      download the code from remote repository(fetch) git fetch (file will come to local remote area)
      you have to merge (here the destination is master branch)-->git checkout master-->git merge remote/origin/master
      git status
      git push -u origin master
      git branch -r -->remote branches will be printed
      git fetch (whatever remote files are there that will be fetched)
      behind means one commit behind the remote origin master
      git merge remote/origin/master
    Second method :
       git pull method automatically local repository and local remote repository
    How to pull a particluar file from remote branch??
      git cherrypick <commit-id>
    How to copy remote repository files for a new developer:
        git clone <git-url>
    How to give an access to a developer in github
    settings--->collaborators-->add people
