version control system:
how to work with multiple files in git:
nothing to commit, working tree clean--->which means the files are commited the local repository.
how to filter git log information: git log --oneline(entire  information will bw given)
bafcac5 (HEAD -> master) craeted empty file
e9a3fe0 created
e9fbc79 added line of code
d3e510a added extra code
0e85cb2 first program

it is displaying 7 character commit id
head always poits to the latest commit
how to find the code changes based on commit of code timely bases: git log --oneline --since yyyy-mm-dd
 git log --oneline --since 2023-07-14
how to find the code commits before the date until
git log --oneline --until 2023-07-05

which menas until 10th we have commits.

Note:want to know the commits after the particlular date use since
:want to know the commits before the particlular date use until

want to know who wrote or modified code:  git log --author "sudha" --oneline
want to combine :git log --author "sudha" --oneline --since yyyy-mm-dd--->this can give since sudha how many commits she done
To search huge files by author:git log --author "sudha" --oneline --grep "first.java"(usimg grep command for search)
to understand the last 10 commit id's:git log -5(here you will get last 5 commits)
how to differentiate between 2 days of commit:
   between 2 range of dates:git log --since 2023-07-05 --until 2023-07-08 --oneline --author "sudha" -1(we can combine every command -1 means last change done by the author)
   single - for integers double - for strings
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Want to track .txt or.py or .java files
if you want to ignore some files:
ignoring the file types: .gitignore--->this is a hidden file as developer or devops engineer can craete
 *.py
 *.txt
 *.docker  like this we can give syntax in gitignore file
