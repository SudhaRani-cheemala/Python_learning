 Linux mass user creation:
 Usually to do a task on o/s we are executing each and every command manually like ad hoc commands
 How to automate o/s related actions or tasks
 bin/sh-->bourn shell   
 bin/bash --> bourn again shell
 Shell Scripting:
   sequence of commands with some logic
#!/bin/bash --->the first line of the shell file
here the # will be ignored 
everything in linux is treated as a string   
How to execute shell scripts:
  method1: using shell method /bin/bash scriptname
  [ec2-user@ip-172-31-28-243 ~]$ /bin/bash hello.sh
hello iam sudha from hyd
this method will not ask for execution permission
method2:Full path method
  /home/user/scripts/first.sh
method 3: short path method
./first.sh
. dot means current working directory
we can give permission for file 
string method:rwx
number method :421
chmod 777-->full permission
chmod +x file name
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
when you add another shabng line after
 #!/bin/bash
 #!/bin/tcsh
 if you not give shabang line also the script will execute
because it has a root user root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
for some users itbis not possible like systemd-network:x:192:192:systemd Network Management:/:/usr/sbin/nologin
Variables:
->it is a name/lable given to a memory location
->to hold a value untill the script is there this memory location will hold a value short period or long period of time
Different types of Variables in shell scripting:
1).System Variables:which means along with o/s few variables will be created
ex:SHELL,PATH,HOME all these are generated along with o/s installation
2)User variables:
Administartor will create these variables
ex:ORGNAME,VER,MARKS
***3).Shell variables:only used by shell only
ex:$0,$1,$2,
How to see values of a variables:
  -- we need to use $ with variable name
  syntax:$<variable-name>
How to list all the Variables in linux
  #env
How to give naming conventions to the variables:
All capital letter can be used good practice.
Start variable name with capital letter
we an start with _ ex:_Orgname
ending with a number is also ok hhhh909
Invalid naming conventions :
no spl characters otherthan _ (underscore)
Do not start with number (86hdhhh)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to define variables:
methods:
1).command line method:
#export ORGNAME=xyz
the lifetime of variable is the moment the session stops the varaible will dies
2).In shell scripts:
  ORGNAME=xyz
  the lifespan of variable is untill the sripts runs
3).for variable permenant storing purpose
 Profile file  ~/.bash-Profilefile when you define your variable inside profile file so the life span of varaible did't depends on session or scripts
 Dont use linux existig commands as variable names (ex:echo,pwd,whoami)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 How to destroy variable:
  unset <variable_name>
  unset ORGNAME
