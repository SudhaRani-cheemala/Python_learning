rpm -qa here we can give sub arguments here a is arguments query all packages in the operating system
rpm -qi before installation we have to know the total information about the package(which version and is this compatible with redhat or not)
rpm -ql what files are there(query list list out all the packages)
rpm -qF from which package that command/file is executed
rpm -ivh <package name>-->to install packages
rpm -e  --->uninstall packages e is erase
before removing packages dont remove the dependencies in that case we have to use-->rpm -e --nodeps <package name>
rpm -qa | wc -l--->list out the number of packages 
rpm -qa | less --->page by page it will display the packages(after enter this command it will go into search option press "f" for forward,press "b" for backward,press "q" for exit)
rpm -qf /etc/passwd ---> which gives the file location and which package
Go to the resource dot file--->copy the link--> go to terminal wget (paste link for package)
